# C-Assignment

1.  Two integer A & B is given. Find no of bit need to be flipped to convert A to B.
2.  Consider a register with data 10110011. Print the cumulative xor result with 18,72 & 36.
3.  Take two strings as input & compare it using “==” operator.
4.  Write a function to remove repeating characters from string. ( pass argument using pointers)
5.  Declare a structure with following member and print it size.
-   Status1 : 1 bit (int)
-   Status2: 1 bit (int)
-   Size : 4 bit (int)
-   Data : size (string)
6.  Two integer A & B is given. Update A=A+B, B= |A-B| using pointers.
7.  a,b,c three numbers are given find the Nth term where next term is defined as a+b+c.
		Ex: 1,2,3,6,11,20,37……
8.  allocate 3kb memory to a void pointer, then reallocate 5kb.
9.  Write a C program to show passing a function as argument to another.
10.  two-bit sequences as strings are given, write a function to return the addition of two sequences.
		Ex. str1 =1100011 & str2= 10, then the function should return 1100101.
11.  Consider a unsigned integer a, swap the even positions bit to its adjacent right bits.
12.  print all prime numbers smaller than or equal to n, where n is unsigned integer.
13.  A encoding use case following logic
		Input = wwwwaaadexxxxxx output = w4a3d1e1x6
		Write a function for it.
14.  How union differ with structure show with example.
